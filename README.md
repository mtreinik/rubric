# Rubric - simplify giving formative feedback

Rubric is a tool for creating interactive assessment rubrics.

# Assessment rubrics

A rubric is a set of criteria used to evaluate students' responses.

This tool allows teachers to create rubrics and fill them out.

Here the emphasis is not on grading but giving feedback to the student with
an easy and efficient tool.

# Design principles

- User can create, save and open their own rubrics
- User can create feedback based on a rubric
- User can export feedback to Google Docs
- Works in a browser
- No server needed

# Development

## TODO

- rename app on heroku
- unselect after copy-pasting
- add documentation
- aria tags for accessibility

## Developing and building Rubric

Install dependencies:

```
nvm use
yarn install
```

Run development server:

```
cd client
yarn install
yarn start
```

Run UI tests:

```
cd client
yarn test
```

Build production site:

```
yarn build
```

## Technology

Rubric is developed by using many tools:

- The app is coded in the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programming language.

- Packages are managed with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), which runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

- The UI is built with the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library and uses
  [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) components,
  [Material Design icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) and the
  [Roboto Font](https://github.com/googlefonts/roboto).

- The UI is provided in English and Finnish with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/)
  internationaliation framework.

- The app is tested automatically with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme),
  which use [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest),
  [enzyme-adapter-react-16](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) and
  [enzyme-to-json](https://github.com/adriantoine/enzyme-to-json) to test React components with tests coded in
  TypeScript and compare the results against [JSON](https://www.json.org/) snapshots.

- Code is analysed and formatted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

- The app is bundled with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
  and the bundle size is analyzed with
  [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer).
- Webpack loads TypeScript code with [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) and resolves and injects CSS
  files with [css-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) and
  [style-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/).

- The built app is hosted by a small [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server.

- App development with live reloading is done with
  [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).

- App state is manipulated with the help of the [optics-ts](https://github.com/akheron/optics-ts) optics library.

- Files uploaded by user are validated with the [ajv](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv) JSON Schema validator.

- HTML input given by user is sanitized with [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify).
